goal: simple A/B testing.  (yes or no response, i.e. 1 or 0 response)
time horizons for prediction: 1,2,3,4,5,10,20 days

tradable prices: opens, midprices


things to predict:
-did the market stay above a price for a certain period of time?
-did the market stay below a price for a certain period of time?
-did the market stay within a range for a certain period of time?
-did the market exceed a range within a certain period of time?
-did the market go up?
-did the market go down?
-did the market go up/down by x times as much as a normalizing value?
  normalizing values:
  -up -> open-low range
  -down -> open-high range
  -either -> previous bar open/close range
  -either -> previous bar high/low range
  -either -> previous multi-bar range
-was the market price change in the top x of the past y days?
-was the market price change in the bottom x of the past y days?
-was the market price range in the top x of the past y days?
-was the market price range in the bottom x of the past y days?

metrics to use for prediction:
(done)-largest price change in x periods? (done)
(done)-rank of price change out of past x periods? (done)
-series of largest price changes
(done)-smallest price change in x periods? (done)
-series of smallest price changes in x periods
-sequence of smallest/largest price changes
(done)-first up day in x periods (done)
(done)-first down day in x periods (done)
(done)-smallest up day in series of up days (done)
(done)-smallest down day in series of down days (done)
(done)-largest up day in series of up days (done)
(done)-largest down day in series of down days (done)
-price change bigger than range of past x periods
-up day bigger than range of past x periods
-down day bigger than range of past x periods
-first up day in x periods, also bigger than range of y periods
-first down day in x periods, also bigger than range of y periods
-first up day bigger than any down day in x periods
-first down day bigger than any up day in x periods
(done)-highest price in past x periods (done)
(done)-lowest price in past x periods (done)
-count of new highs made in past x periods
-count of new lows made in past x periods
-ratio of open-close range to high-low range
-ratio of up movement to down movement in past periods (i.e. sum(close - open for up bars) / sum(open - close for down bars))


we can combine these metrics as well.

if we transform the data into waves, we can do additional metrics on the waves
