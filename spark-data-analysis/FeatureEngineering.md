### Normalization and Standardization
In order to be useful across markets, all features need to be normalized.  i.e. % change is useless.

Categorical features should fit the bill always.  Otherwise, ratios of things should work.

Standardizing features to have mean = 0, variance = 1 is also a thing that ML routines seems to like.
I'm not sure if that is generally necessary or if there are certain algorithms that need it. (PCA seems to like it)
